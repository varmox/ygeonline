            The new VCF 5.2 Update delivers quite a few interesting updates. This blog post covers expecially the updates and improvements for Tanzu.
Part 1 covers new Feature within Tanzu on vSphere 8 Update 3.
vSphere with Tanzu Update -&amp;gt; vSphere IaaS Control Plane vSphere with Tanzu is passé - the new naming is vSphere IaaS Control Plane.
The naming already suggest - not only Kubernetes Cluster can be deployed, also VMs (this was possible a long time but with the new naming the focus is not only on k8s).

      <title>VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid -  getting started</title>

            Intro This blog post is about getting started with VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG). TKG is used to deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster to various Cloud Providers including vSphere, AWS and Azure. First, a management cluster (based on Docker and kind) is created from a Bootstrap Workstation, which itself then provides its web interface and additional CLI tools to create a Kubernetes cluster.
TKG has no integration in vSphere UI. If you wan&#39;t to integrate Tanzu with vCenter/vSphere UI - use vSphere with Tanzu instead.

            Intro VMware vSAN is a Hyperconverged Infrastructure Solution from VMware. It basically turns your servers direct attached disks into a storage cluster.
General Requirements 10 GbE network switches are the minimum requirement for all-flash vSAN Clusters 25 GBE network switches are recommended Switches that support higher port speeds are designed with higher Network Processor Unit (NPU) buffers. An NPU shared switch buffer of at least 16 MB is recommended for 10 GbE network connectivity.

            vSphere Monitoring with TIG (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Grafana) This blog post describes a solution for monitoring SDDC infrastructure using Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana. This solution is based on Docker and displays graphs and metrics via Grafana. All metrics are described in the telegraf.conf file.
TL;DR: https://github.com/varmox/vsphere-monitoring.git
Prerequiries RHEL based Linux Docker &amp;amp; Docker Compose (or Podman with Docker Compose. In this tutorial we are using docker &amp;amp; docker compose) installed 3 internal IPs for telegraf, grafana and influxdb containers.

            Quick Tip: vSphere with Tanzu an HA-Proxy This is a short article with tips and tricks I experienced when deploying vSphere with Tanzu and HA-Proxy as a Load Balancer.
Deploying Ha-Proxy OVA Network
Alwasys use three NICs when deploying in a production environment. It is very important that these IP addresses do not overlap with the address ranges of your workloads and load balancers, or with the gateway itself.
At first it can be somewhat confusing what networks are needed and which services will be deployed in each network.
