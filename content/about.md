### Why vBünzli?

**The meaning of Bünzli**
*While it is difficult to translate precisely, even for Swiss people, it is generally accepted that Bünzli describes a person who is very conformist and is always prepared to ask others to abide by the rules*

or as other internet fellows describe it in schwizerdütsch:

*..Bünzli isch nid nume e "schteit of mäind" sondern würklech e Läbensart...*
