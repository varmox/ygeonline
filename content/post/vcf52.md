The new VCF 5.2 Update delivers quite a few interesting updates. This blog post covers expecially the updates and improvements for Tanzu.

Part 1 covers new Feature within Tanzu on vSphere 8 Update 3.

## vSphere with Tanzu Update -> vSphere IaaS Control Plane

vSphere with Tanzu is pass√© - the new naming is vSphere IaaS Control Plane. 

The naming already suggest - not only Kubernetes Cluster can be deployed, also VMs (this was possible a long time but with the new naming the focus is not only on k8s). Via the vm-operator you can deploy VMs alongside Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster. The IaaS Control Plane is really interesting as you can deploy VMs with Code. A YAML File will describe your VM. For that the VM Class now support much more configuration, it handled like a normal VM provisioned through vSphere UI.

It is even possible to deploy Windows Workloads via VM-Operator with sysprep! (blog to follow)

Deployment of Windows Server within a ArgoCD Pipeline is possible (if you would want that ;))

Now also the Backup via vSphere Storage APIs for Data Protection (VADP) for VMs deployed via vm-operator are supportet (as "normal" VMs) - within Veeam you can just backup the whole vSphere Namespace (with is basically a advanced vSphere Ressource Pool)

## LCI - Local consumption Interface

With the new Local Consumption Interface within vSphere UI you can deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters or VMs - both via IaaS Control Plane with a GUI!

Surely some of you already knew the Cloud Consumption Interface (CCI) within Aria - Local Cloud Consumption Interface is a built in UI within vSphere UI (no need to deploy Aria)

#### LCI Installation

LCI is a supervisor Service. Supervisor Services are deployed directly to the Supervisor instead of deploying to a TKGS Cluster.

## vSAN streched Cluster support for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service (TKGs)

With vSphere 8 Update 3 TKGS now supports vSAN streched Clusters. Interesting is that Kubernetes Control Plane Nodes and the Supervisor Control Plane Nodes should be kept at one site within a vSAN streched Clusters. This is due to etcd. etcd  requires more than half of the replicas to be available at any time.

- The 3 Supervisor Control Plane VMs should be placed in the same site
- All the Control Plane VMs of any given TKGs cluster should be placed in the same site
- Worker Nodes can be streched acroos two sites

## Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaling

As the name already suggest: Autoscaling of Tanzu Kubernetes Workers Nodes (VMs)! Only requirements is to have TKR Relase 1.25
