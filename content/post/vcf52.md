The new VCF 5.2 Update delivers quite a few interesting updates. This blog post covers expecially the updates and improvements for Tanzu.

## vSphere with Tanzu Update -> vSphere IaaS Control Plane

vSphere with Tanzu is pass√© - the new naming is vSphere IaaS Control Plane.

The naming already suggest - not only Kubernetes Cluster can be deployed, also VMs (this was possible a long time but with the new naming the focus is not only on k8s). Via the vm-operator you can deploy VMs alongside Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster. The IaaS Control Plane is really interesting as you can deploy VMs with Code. A YAML File will describe your VM. It is even possible to deploy Windows Workloads via VM-Operator with sysprep! (blog to follow)

Deployment of Windows Server within a ArgoCD Pipeline is possible (if you would want that ;))

## LCI - Local consumption Interface

With the new Local Consumption Interface within vSphere UI you can deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters or VMs - both via IaaS Control Plane with a GUI!

Surely some of you already knew the Cloud Consumption Interface (CCI) within Aria - Local Cloud Consumption Interface is a built in UI within vSphere UI (no need to deploy Aria)

## Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaling

As the name already suggest: Autoscaling of Tanzu Kubernetes Workers Nodes (VMs)! Only requirements is to have TKR Relase 1.25.
